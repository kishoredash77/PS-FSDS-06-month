+ - operator 

===== 23rd
this is new batch on fsds, generative ai , agentic ai
3days ago we start this new batch walk through 3days 

1- name of the course
2- who am i ? my intrdouction ( 18+ )
3- who can learn this course 
4- roadmap of this course  (5-6 month)

6- learning path 
7- course certification 
8- job placement ( student job offer)
9- what is laptop configuarion 
10- python work with number
 
we havent start any code yet
the learner who joined for the 1st time, 2nd time, not a problem at all i will share 4 days recording session. 
today we will start 1st python programming language 
python is foundation for everything ( ml prediction model, llm model, backend, frontend ) 
introduction of python 
if any learner already completed python -- python with data, ai 
everytopic iw ill start from -- experience -- i wnat you to be little patience 

==== we will start python code today 

1- So Today we will work few basic concept then i will teach you how to install 
2- google -- 

python concept  
1- work with number
2- work with string
3- work with string slicing
4- work with variable createion 
5- how to installatioon anaconda software 

online team -- just calm down .. happily we student 

excel - .xlcs 
pdf - .pdf
word - .doc 
xml - .xml 
python programming languag - .py 
if you work in jupyter noteboak -- .ipynb (interactive python notebook)

watc-- .mp3 | .mp4

coding language text -- string 
today onwards you will call as string 
string everytime writtne in ' ' | "" | ''' '''
difference between ' ' | " " | ''' ''' 

' ' | " " - we use for single line string 
''' ''' -- you will be using for multiline string 

forward music >>> ( left to right) 
backward music <<<< (right to lift)

index 
forward index 
backward index 

everytime we cannot use google colab 

we need to learn how to install the software in local machine -->

local machine -- personal laptop -- local server -- when you install database in your personal laptop 
technical word is called local 

free = open source 
---
STEPS TO INSTALL SOFTWARE IN LOCAL MACHINE -->
----
1- Google 
2- Type anaconda python 
3- click the first link -- https://www.anaconda.com/download
4- give your gmail id  
5- window- python 64 bit - python 3.13 latest version 
6- installation of software 
7- please wathc the video which i shared 

==== 24th
yesterday how to install software to work with datascience, data analytics, llm  
most of learnes already installed it 
let me khow who ever facing issue after registered 
i will share mentor link -- you can ask directly clear 
the student who joined for 1st time, 2time i will recap the quick session 
nhe student who joined 1st t, 2nd time i will take backup class last 10 ,
i wil uumute you if you have any question we will discuss 
llm model are 2 part -->
	1st - Text based model ( user -- enter text & model generate the text) 
	2nd - multi model -- user - wrte text & model generate audio, iamge, video )
			sota ( state of the art model) 
openai model | google model | meta model | deepseek model | ollama model 
python -
		python 
		java script
		ruby 
1- python fast programming language 
2- python will use - da, graphs, ml, ai, dl, nn, gen ai, llm ,prompt engie, agentic ai, 
								 dashboard , cloud, database, everywhere 
3- z- expert level 
4- to learn any programming language we need to software 
		anaconda
			jupyter notebook
			spyder 
	i wil share one link to you today installation file -- please watch & Complete this & later also i will explain you 
	yesterday i already explain & I will explain again
5- IDE ( INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT)
			error -- bugs | fix the error - debugging 
6- python interpreter vs compiler 
	 user execute the code line by line or group of lines isc alled interpreterd 
	  exucture entire code at once -- compiler 
whenever you build user have to entire code at once 
 while we practise code we need to run line by line 

7- do not compare java to python | c to python 
8- python is object orient programin glanguage (oops) 
		class 
		method 
		object 
		encapsulation 
		polymorphism
		inheritence
		abstraction 
9- all real time work solve by object only 		
10- python was release on 1989 java relase on 1995 
11- no one used python 
12- python job market from last 2015 onward -- next decade 
13- almost fortune 500 companies are using python 
14- python is dynamic programing language 
15- python is platform independent ( write codeonce) apply every os 
			window os
			mac os
			linxos 
16- python only easy & user friendly to learn datascience application 
17- any person must have to recognize based on speaking, behaveio, explanation, 

====  25th 

1- Demos  we are completed 
2- who ever new student last 10 min i will take the back up classes

4- everyone did you install anaconda 
		for the time being who ever not install please work with on google colab
	next week i will show how to insall vs code 
5- monday - github creation, vscode installation 
6- every day what ever you will work please keep post in your github 
7- python codeing --	
			number, string, python variable creation 
			
8- variable == identifier == object 
		variable name = value 
		
9- learner who ever join for the 1st time online & Offlien just listen class 45 min. 
	last 10 min -- back up classes ( how to install all those thing)

---
Rules to define pythoon variable -->
---
1- VARIABLE NEVER START WITH NUMBER 
2- variable case sensitive 
3- special chareactare is not allowed only _allowed  
4- keywords never be an varibale or identifier 

python variable is completed 

variable = value 
							int value 
							float value 
							complex value 
							string value 
							boolean value 

values are called as data type

keyword or reservce word we cannot defina as variable 
		every prograiming we have some resevce words
				c - reserve word | c++, java, | python also 
	if you understand all reseerve word then python is compeltd 

do not write complte word  in programe 

- call the varibal with the name which you define 
		puspa1 = 1000
		puspa1
		puspa2
